# 🤖 Line Follower Bot Challenge
### Organized by **YANTRA - The IoT Club**

🚀 Welcome to the **Line Follower Bot Challenge** repository! This event, hosted by **YANTRA - The IoT Club**, focuses on designing, developing, and coding autonomous robots that follow a predefined path using sensor-based navigation.

---

## 📌 About the Challenge
The **Line Follower Bot** is an autonomous robot that detects and follows a line drawn on the surface. The challenge encourages participants to:
- Develop **efficient algorithms** for line following.
- Utilize **sensors** such as IR, ultrasonic, or camera-based vision.
- Implement **real-time obstacle handling**.
- Optimize **speed and stability**.

---

## 🔥 Features of this Repository
- 📜 **Source Code** for line-following algorithms.
- 🔧 **Circuit Diagrams** and hardware setup details.
- 📷 **Images & Videos** of bots in action.
- 📚 **Documentation** on sensor calibration and logic implementation.
- 🏆 **Top Submissions** from the challenge.
